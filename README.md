# Network Automation

## What is network automation?
Network automation refers to the process of using software and tools to automate the configuration, management, testing, deployment, and operation of physical and virtual network devices. This can include routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and other network infrastructure components. The goal of network automation is to increase the efficiency, reliability, and consistency of network operations, reduce manual intervention, and minimize human error.

## Why we need network automation?
Network automation is crucial for managing modern, complex networks efficiently, consistently, and securely. It enables organizations to scale, reduce costs, improve performance, and innovate rapidly, all while minimizing human error and ensuring compliance with standards and policies
